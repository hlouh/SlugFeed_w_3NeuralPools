%At different weightage of the a1 and a2 variables (initial conditions), the seaweed could leave the slug's mouth (despite pulling) or enter.
 Both the inward movement of the seaweed and and the outward, biologically infeasible movement, have optimum/worst performing weightages


%%%Note, the two datasets below were generated with Fsw = 0.05, not 0, but similar behavior seemed to have been seen when Fsw=0

Shaw_sixDiffeq_Fsw0.05_0_0.1_3
 - weight 1 and weight 2 vecotrs were 0:0.1:3
 - This calculated for the most optimal and least optimal parameter weighting of a1 and a2
 - Optimal length is the minimum (lowest point) of the seaweed over time 
	<-->0 could mean either the seaweed moved out of the mouth or did not move
 - Worst length is the maxium (lowest point) of the seaweed over time 
	<-->0 could mean either the seaweed did not move or that it was pulled into the mouth
Shaw_sixDiffeq_Fsw0.05_0_0.1_5
 - weight 1 and weight 2 vecotrs were 0:0.1:5
 - This calculated for the most optimal parameter weighting of a1 and a1
	-- This follows the same rule for optimal length as shown above
